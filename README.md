# Portland Dog Runner
<p>Website for Portland Dog Runner. This is a mobile-first responsive website that changes depending on the screen size for phones, tablets, and computers. It uses JavaScript to move an aside section as the page scrolls with the main section. It also features a photo gallery with a modal that includes an interactive carousel.</p>

<p>I've included a link below to the GitHub previewer, but most of the site's functionality, well, doesn't function. To see this all working properly, please download/clone the files and serve them on your local machine. This way the JavaScript will work as it should.</p>

<p>View a preview of the <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevJHennessy/PortlandDogRunner/master/index.html">website</a>. Note that none of the JavaScript works in the GitHub previewer, so the modal doesn't work and the aside doesn't move with the page as it actually does. This also means the hamburger icon does not work for the mobile screen sizes. Sadly, this site will not be made live, as the company has chosen to stick with WordPress.</p>
